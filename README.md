# Fragment Experiments

This project houses a number of Android applications which each demonstrate a particular problem of the [Fragment](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/fragment/app/Fragment) class.

The applications in this project are as follows:

* [app1](app1) – Fragment restoration bug when Fragment is added in an Activity
* [app2](app2) – Fragment restoration bug when Fragment is added in another Fragment
